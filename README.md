## About

**`htbmachines.sh`** is a Bash-based command-line utility to query Hack The Box (HTB) machine data from the community-maintained `bundle.js` database.  
It allows you to **search machines by name, IP address, skills, OS, difficulty**, or browse interactively by category.

This tool is ideal for:
-  HTB players who want fast recon of machines
-  Keeping track of progress or searching for skill-based practice
-  Filtering targets for specific certifications or challenges

> ðŸ“¦ Requires internet for updates, and uses a local cached JS file once downloaded.
